# Guess-the-number---Python
Guess the number which the computer has generated using random function!

If user inputs a number (top_of_range), for eg 100, then the range from which the compiler generates a random number is from 0 to 100.. Let's say compiler randomly selected 53 as the integer. And now the guessing game starts!
